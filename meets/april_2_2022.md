## Selection Sort

* Selection sort: If you take selection sort and use it with a heap, you get heapsort.

## Heaps

* In a min heap, the invariant is that for any given node, node.val <= val of its children.
* In the bubble up (insertion), you only need to look at the parent.
* But when you're coming down (deletion), you're comparing the node's children.
* Under the hood, a heap is implemented an array. Given 1-index node ith:
  * left node -> 2i
  * right node -> 2i + 1
  * parent -> floor(i/2)
* Given 0-index node ith:
  * left node -> 2i + 1
  * right node -> 2i + 2
  * parent -> floor((i - 1)/2)
* A heap is complete, but not necessarily balanced.

## Binary Tree
* A worst case of a binary tree is node n.
* A good binary tree should have a height is roughl equal to lg(n).
